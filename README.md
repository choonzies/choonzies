## Hi there 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me :
A student currently in the National University of Singapore majoring in Computer Science.

I’m currently looking into discovering and learning new tech stacks to expand my knowledge in Software Engineering. My ideal project is a well-defined application with excellent user use cases, built on clean, extensible code. I place great emphasis on writing maintainable code that’s easy to scale, and I’m always eager to improve and explore new technologies to elevate my work.
